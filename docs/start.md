# Bonjour Hi

I put some of my IT related documentations here.

Just began working on this docs site, which means:

- Structures and directories are guaranteed to change, may not be a good idea to use url of a specific page on this site
- French translations are minimal for now
- Iâ€™ll to keep the docs updated, better see the updated date before use it
- I do a lot of experiments for now, codes may contain mistakes, only one way to find out, what could go wrong?
